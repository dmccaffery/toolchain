# go-cli.mk — archetype for a Go CLI application (dotty, evolve, gh-claude).
#
# Usage (repo Makefile):
#     APP     := dotty
#     APP_PKG := ./cmd
#     include make/go-cli.mk
#
# Wires the fragment helpers into the canonical lint/build/test/ci/pr contract.
# The canonical targets are pure prerequisite aggregators (no recipe), so a repo
# can extend them by adding prerequisites, e.g. `build: ui` or `pr: docs`.

# `docs` is intentionally left to the repo — regenerating a CLI reference is
# app-specific (`./$(APP) docs …`). A repo defines it and appends to the gate:
#     docs: build ; @ ./$(APP) docs --out docs/cli --format markdown && $(MAKE) docs-build
#     pr: docs
# `serve`, `docs-build`, and `sync` come ready-made from docs.mk.
